# Bevy Snake

This is my first attempt with Bevy engine. I tried to implement basic stuff, but at the same time to make it look like a real project. So, I tried to add some 
module architecture with plugins. There a some issues still with the game but I'm not sure if I will get back to it and fix them. Here's what's in the code so far:
- Division by plugins for major game entities, which in turn devide by components/systems/etc.
- Start menu with buttons.
- Game state transitions (Start Menu / In Game / Game Over).
- Events examples.
- Simple collision examples.

## Quick start
```bash
cargo run
```
